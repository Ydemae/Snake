Hello, I am Ydemae, a cs student.
I made this little raylib project in c++ to learn this new language's syntax through a fun project.
This project also had the objective to make me realise how much game engines carried me in my last games.
I think this project did it's job by teaching me little things I didn't have to think about when programming on a game engine.

This project was done thanks to raylib so if you want to give it a try, take a look at https://www.raylib.com/

The command to compile the game is :
g++ MySnake.cpp -o MySnake.exe -Wall -mwindows -std=c++20 -Wno-missing-braces -I include/ -L Lib/ -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm

Make sure you have raylib, opengl, lgdi and winmm installed for compiling, you can also just download the .exe if you want.

Anyway I wish you a good day, bye.
